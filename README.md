# BeeSimulation
Small piece of code simulating bee flight
I was watching some youtube videos on math for game developers when i came across a wonderfully simple simulation for bug flight.
While multiplying sin and cos of an increasing angle by the same length gives you a circle - multiplying sin and cos by "different" lengths gives you an effect that really looks like a flying insect.
To spice things up i had the bugs follow my mouse with some simple easing.
